## 3. Critical Path Analysis

The **critical path** includes:
Requirements → Data Pipeline → Model Development → Integration → UAT → Go-Live.
Any delay in data pipeline or model development directly impacts the delivery timeline.

**Dependencies:**

* Data Engineering completion is a prerequisite for Model Development.
* API & dashboard integration depend on finalized model endpoints.
* UAT depends on integrated system readiness.
