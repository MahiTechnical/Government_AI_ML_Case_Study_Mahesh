## **AI Project Case Study:** Government-Wide AI/ML Implementation & Risk Management

[  We’ll use a Traffic Management AI System as the example use case 

(e.g., an AI platform to optimize traffic flow, predict congestion, and manage incidents across the city). ]


**Client: Abu Dhabi Government – Department of Transport & AI Council**

**Project Role: Scrum Master**

**Duration: 12 Months**

**Methodology: Agile–Scrum**

**Version: 1.0**


## **Part A: Project Planning and Strategy (40%)**

### **1. Comprehensive Project Plan**

#### **Project Overview**

This project aims to implement a Government-Wide AI/ML platform to optimize traffic management across Abu Dhabi. The system will integrate IoT devices, video feeds, and real-time analytics to predict congestion, adjust signals dynamically, and enhance road safety.

| Vendor lock-in (Cloud provider)    | Medium   | Medium      | Use open standards and containerization        |
| Cybersecurity vulnerabilities      | Critical | Low         | Regular penetration testing and SOC monitoring |

#### **Go/No-Go Decision Points**

* ML Model accuracy ≥ 90% on validation data.
* All integration test cases passed.
* Stakeholder sign-off on UAT.
* Budget variance < 10%.

#### **Success Criteria**

### **2. Stakeholder Management Strategy**

#### **Communication Matrix**

| Stakeholder             | Role       | Frequency | Channel          | Owner         |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Department of Transport | Sponsor    | Bi-weekly | Steering Meeting | PMO Lead      |
| PMO                     | Oversight  | Weekly    | Teams/Email      | Scrum Master  |
| Vendor Partners         | Delivery   | Daily     | Jira/Slack       | Tech Lead     |
| RTA Operations          | End-User   | Bi-weekly | Dashboard Review | Product Owner |
| IT Security             | Compliance | Monthly   | Audit Reports    | Risk Manager  |

#### **Conflict Resolution Strategy**

* Use **RACI Matrix** for clear accountability.
* Escalation path: Scrum Master → PMO → Steering Committee.
* Conflicts logged in Jira and tracked until closure.

#### **Change Management Process**

1. Submit Change Request (CR) via Jira.
2. PMO performs impact assessment (time, cost, scope).
3. Steering Committee approves or defers CR.
4. Update sprint backlog accordingly.
