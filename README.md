**AI Project Case Study:** Government-Wide AI/ML Implementation & Risk Management

[ We’ll use a Traffic Management AI System as the example use case (e.g., an AI platform to optimize traffic flow, predict congestion, and manage incidents across the city). ]

# AI/ML-Based Smart Traffic Management System

**Client:** Abu Dhabi Government – Department of Transport & AI Council

**Project Title:** Government-Wide AI/ML Implementation for Smart Traffic Management

**Scrum Master:** Mahesh H.

**Duration:** 12 Months

**Methodology:** Agile-Scrum Framework

## 1. Comprehensive Project Plan

### 1.1 Project Objective

Develop and deploy a city-wide AI/ML platform that optimizes traffic flow, predicts congestion, and provides real-time decision support for the Abu Dhabi Transport Authority. The system will leverage camera feeds, IoT sensors, GPS data, and weather inputs to improve mobility and safety.

### 1.4 Critical Path & Dependencies

**Critical Path:**
Requirements → Data Pipeline Setup → Model Training → Integration → UAT → Go-Live

**Dependencies:**

* Data pipeline must be complete before model training.
* API integration depends on stable model endpoints.
* UAT depends on completed system integration.

Delays in data engineering or model tuning directly affect downstream phases.
